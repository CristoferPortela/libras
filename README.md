## What does is Libras

Libras stands for Lingua Brasileira de Sinais (Brasilian sign language)
it is the second official language in Brazil.

## Why should I learn it?

I admit, if you are not brazilian, there aren't much reasons to do that
except if you are deaf and want to come to brazil, otherwise, if you are
brazilian, I can't see no reason to not learn libras!
